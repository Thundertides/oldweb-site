        Haiiiii <3

        My name is <i>Luna</i>~ I know that is very sterotypical, but I didnt know at the time!
        I like <font color=#FB000C>g</font><font color=#FF8C3A>i</font><font color=#FFFFFF>r</font><font color=#D34398>l</font><font color=#C2006C>s</font> and making things. I will probably add stuff to this but I also have a blog linked on the left side.
        <br><br>
        I am trying to get into creating more stuff to quench my never ending thirst for creative work.
        Feel free to steal any of my code on this website as I am just messing around with CSS and HTML here. Also if you have any ideas of cool things I can do just in general, let me know (I say as there is no way to communicate with me here lol).
        <br><br>
        I have many hobbies including programming, drawing, game design, writing, and so so so many other things.
        Some of my favorite pieces of media/characters are:
        <ul>
